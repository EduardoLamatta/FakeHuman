Oh, I'm glad you've arrived! ;We trust you.;I'm scared.;You make me proud
Welcome to my little game, where the fate of your family is in your hands. ;You can save us. ;Please, save us.;You're really putting in effort.
I've taken your loved ones as hostages, and now it's up to you to save them. ;Please help us. ;Did you save him?;Come on.
Here's the deal: I have a series of questions prepared. ;I know you'll make it.;Is our son okay?;You're great.
If you answer correctly, I'll release your family.;You're my hero.;I will always love you.;Nothing will stop you.
But if you're wrong... ;You won't be defeated.;Everything will pass.;Don't think about time.
Well, let's just say the consequences will be... Unpleasant.;We are trapped.;I love you.;We won't die.
haha! Are you ready?;Your mind will set us free.;I'm very nervous.;Tomorrow we'll laugh about this.
